### Repository
This repository contains python code from several projects and quizzes of GEOG: 5055 Geospatial Programming. 
Within this course, I completed two projects: 

**1. Geospatial progamming topic presentation/coding tutorial**
   
   I gave a presentation on object oriented programming to the class and create a coding tutorial on the topic for students to use. The tutorial code and presentation is     available in the object oriented programming zip file. 
   
**2. Final project**
   
   My topic for the course final project is heat vulnerability and cooling centers in the greater Des Moines area. The code and results for the project is available in the     final project zip file. 
   

### About me:

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Iowa pursuing a B.A. degree in geography (GIS Track) with a minor in Computer Science and a minor in Environmental Policy and Planning. I am also enrolled in the University of Iowa Undergraduate-to-Graduate M.S. degree program in Geoinformatics.

Over the past few years of studying geography, I have become much interested in how GIS and data science can be used to change or understand the world as we know it. I hope to gain and use knowledge to identify problems and provide solutions to both environmental and social challenges related to topics such as disasters, climate change, pollution, health, and wellbeing. 

Througout my undergraduate career, I have had the opportunity to further explore explore my interests by participating in programs as an intern and more recently, a graduate research assistanceship. Please see my CV, resume or LinkedIn for more about research in which I have contributed.
