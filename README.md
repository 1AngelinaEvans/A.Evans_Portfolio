## Hello, my name is Angelina Evans.

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Iowa pursuing a B.A. degree in Geography (GIS Track) with a minor in Computer Science and a minor in Environmental Policy and Planning (Planning Track). I am also enrolled in the University of Iowa Undergraduate-to-Graduate M.S. degree program in Geoinformatics.

Over the past few years of studying Geography, I have become much interested in how GIS and data science can be used to change or understand the world as we know it. I hope to gain and use knowledge to identify problems and provide solutions to both environmental and social challenges related to topics such as disasters, climate change, pollution, health, and wellbeing. 

Througout my undergraduate career, I have had the opportunity to further explore explore my interests by participating in programs as an intern and more recently, a graduate research assistanceship. Please see my CV, resume or LinkedIn page for more about research in which I have contributed.
